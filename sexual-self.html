    <h1 style="font-weight:bold;">What is Sexual Self?</h1></br>

    </br>
    <p style="font-size: 22px;text-indent: 100px;"> Sexual self refers to <i>how one thinks about themself as 
      a sexual individual.</i> It speaks of your sexual health, sexual orientation, gender identity, 
      and expression and values around your sexuality. The <b>sexuality or sex</b> of a person is classified as <i>male, female or intersex.</i>
        A person typically has their sex assigned at birth based on physiological characteristics including 
        their genitalia and chromosome compositions. <b>Gender</b> is a term that refers to social or cultural 
        distinctions associated with a given sex. <b>Gender identity</b> is what is inside us; how we feel about
         our own gender. <b>Sexuality</b> is about who you are attracted to, sexually or romantically. 
         This is also called your <i>sexual orientation</i>  where one’s physical attraction and emotional 
         attraction overlap.</p><br>

          In the present study, factors affecting sexual self-concept were categorized to the following:
          <ul style="font-size: 22px; ">
            <li><i>Biological Factors</i></li>
            <li><i>Psychological Factors</i></li>
            <li><i>Social Factors</i></li>
          </ul>
        </blockquote>
        </p><br><br><br>

        <h1 style="font-weight:bold;">Biological Factors</h1>
        <br>
        <p style="font-size: 22px; text-indent:100px;">Sexual self-concept is <i>feelings, beliefs, and 
          perceptions</i> that people have about their sexual relationships that accordingly 
          adjust their behaviors. Adolescence is the time when the individual's understandings and perceptions 
          of who they are as a sexual creature or their sexual self-concept are stabilized and improved 
          many months or even years before the beginning of any romantic relationship can occur.
           The aspects of sexual self-concept become apparent 
          in early adolescence.
        </p>
        <br><br><br>
        <h1 style="font-weight:bold;">Psychological Factors</h1>
        <br>
        <p style="font-size: 22px; text-indent:100px;">
          The <b>impact of body image</b> is the attitude and perception of the individual 
          and others regarding his/her own appearance and the body. 
          Body image is a multifaceted structure that combines individuals’ 
          understandings and attitudes about the body, especially the physical appearance. 
          This includes knowledge related to <i>appearance (schemas), feelings and behaviors</i>.
           The evaluation of body image can affect interests and experiences of the person 
           during sexual activities. It seems that sexual self-concept is affected by women’s 
           self-perceptions.
        </p>
       <br>
       <p style="font-size: 22px; text-indent:100px;">
        The <b>history of sexual abuse</b> in childhood may affect the development of 
        positive sexual self-concept and put individuals at high risk for <b>sexual 
        dysfunction</b>. Women with a history of child sexual abuse have a 
        lower sexual self-concept compared with else. Moreover, women with sexual disorders have a 
        weaker positive self-concept and stronger negative self-concept compared with those without
         sexual dysfunctions. Therefore, it is likely that sexual self-concept plays a role in the sexual
         function of abused women in childhood. Sexual interactions with coercion and abuse can cause
          negative emotions such as <i>guilt, shame, anger, sorrow and frustration</i>. The survivors of sexual 
          abuse in childhood appear less romantic, sentimental or sensual compared with other women.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p style="font-size: 22px; text-indent:100px;">
        <b>Mental health</b> can affect sexual self-concept, resulting in more negative feelings of sexual inadequacy in <i>schizophrenia and depression patients</i>. They also report less sexual 
        satisfaction. The fear of incompetence and negative emotions in patients 
        with schizophrenia is higher resulting in considerable distress when trying to 
        have sexual relationships. Patients with depressive disorders are unable to enjoy 
        their lives and gradually lose interest in daily activities. 
        Sexual self-concept in patients with depression is changed due to <i>notable 
        volition-drive deficit, low self-esteem, feelings of sexual inadequacy and worthlessness.</i></p>
        <br><br><br>
        <h1 style="font-weight:bold;">Social Factors</h1>
        <br>
        <p style="font-size:22px; text-indent:100px;">
          The role of <b>Parents</b> and peers</b>; <b>Parents</b> are usually the <i>first educators of the sexual 
          identity of children</i> and teach them about love, kindness and humility. 
          Students also report that most information on sexuality is learned by 
          their <b>peers</b>. Furthermore, the socialization of sexual identity means 
          providing information, attitudes and values about sexual issues. 
          This is a complex and multidimensional process that occurs gradually 
          over years using various sources. It encompasses different topics including 
          the biology of reproduction, values and attitudes about dating, sexual relationships, 
          love, emotional and romantic relationships. <b>Sexual messages</b> are transmitted through 
          verbal, non-verbal, direct and indirect methods, and are often subtle, ambiguous and 
          contradictory.

        <h1 style="font-weight:bold;">Contributions of <span style="color:#DB7F00;">Sexual Self</span> to the <span style="color:darkslategray;">Understanding of the Self</span></h1>
        <br>
        <blockquote class="blockquote" style="border-left: 5px solid orange ;">
          <p style="font-size:18px; color:darkslategray; font-style:italic; font-weight: 600;">
            The sexual self is an essential aspect of an individual's 
            identity and contributes significantly to their overall 
            understanding of self. It encompasses a person's sexual orientation, 
            desires, fantasies, behaviors, and attitudes toward their own sexuality.
          </p>
        </blockquote><br>

        <h3 style="font-weight:600;">Here are several ways in which the sexual self contributes to the overall understanding of the self:
        </h3>
        <ul style="font-size: 25px; margin-left:50px; font-weight: 550; color:DarkSlateGray;">
          <li>Identity Formation</li>
          <dd style="font-size:19px; font-weight: normal; margin-bottom:40px; color:black;">- Sexual orientation and gender identity are fundamental components of one's identity. Understanding and accepting one's sexual orientation or gender identity can contribute to a more holistic understanding of oneself. It allows individuals to explore and define their place within society and form connections with others who share similar identities.
          </dd>
          <li>Personal Exploration</li>
          <dd style="font-size:19px; font-weight: normal; margin-bottom:40px; color:black;">- The sexual self provides a platform for personal exploration and self-discovery. By exploring one's sexual desires, fantasies, and preferences, individuals can gain insights into their own needs, boundaries, and what brings them pleasure. This exploration fosters a deeper understanding of oneself, leading to personal growth and a sense of authenticity.
          </dd>
          <li>Emotional and Physical Well-being</li>
          <dd style="font-size:19px; font-weight: normal; margin-bottom:40px; color:black;">- The sexual self plays a crucial role in an individual's emotional and physical well-being. Understanding one's sexual needs, boundaries, and desires helps promote a healthy and fulfilling sexual life. It allows individuals to engage in sexual experiences that are aligned with their values, preferences, and consensual boundaries, leading to greater satisfaction and overall well-being.
          </dd>
          <li>Relationship Dynamics</li>
          <dd style="font-size:19px; font-weight: normal; margin-bottom:40px; color:black;">- The sexual self influences the dynamics within intimate relationships. Understanding one's sexual needs and communicating them effectively with a partner fosters healthier and more satisfying relationships. It helps individuals establish compatibility, navigate consent, and negotiate desires within the context of a partnership. A deeper understanding of one's sexual self can promote empathy, intimacy, and mutual respect between partners.
          </dd>
          <li>Social and Cultural Context</li>
          <dd style="font-size:19px; font-weight: normal; margin-bottom:40px; color:black;">- The sexual self is shaped by social and cultural factors, and in turn, it influences how individuals perceive and interact with society. Recognizing societal attitudes, norms, and expectations related to sexuality allows individuals to understand how these factors have influenced their own sexual self. This awareness can lead to questioning and challenging societal norms and advocating for sexual rights and equality.
          </dd>
          <li>Self-Acceptance and Self-Empowerment</li>
          <dd style="font-size:19px; font-weight: normal; margin-bottom:40px; color:black;">- Embracing and accepting one's sexual self can be a powerful act of self-empowerment. Society often imposes shame, guilt, or stigmatization on various aspects of sexuality. Developing a positive and accepting attitude toward one's sexual self enables individuals to overcome these societal pressures and fosters self-love, self-esteem, and self-confidence.</dd>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <blockquote class="blockquote" style="border-left: 5px solid orange;">
          <p style="font-size:18px; color:darkslategray; font-style:italic; font-weight: 600;">
            Overall, the sexual self is an integral part of an individual's identity, 
            contributing to their self-understanding, personal growth, emotional well-being, 
            and relationships. Exploring, understanding, and accepting one's sexual self can 
            lead to a more authentic and fulfilling life. It is important to note that the 
            understanding of the sexual self is subjective and can vary across individuals
             based on their unique experiences, perspectives, and cultural backgrounds.
