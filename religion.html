        <blockquote class="blockquote">
          <p style="font-size: 22px;">Spirituality can be understood as a search for the sacred, a process through which people
            seek to discover, hold onto, and when necessary, transform whatever they hold sacred in
            their lives. It refers to finding meaning and purpose in oneâ€™s life, a search for wholeness, and
            a relation ship with a transcendent being(higher being).</p>

    <h1>Things You need to know about Spiritual Self</h1></br>

    </br>
    <p style="font-size: 22px;text-indent: 50px;">The <b>Principle of Psychology(1890) </b>by <b>William James</b>, the spiritual self is the most intimate, inner subjective part of self. This is the only part of our self that is able and can experience
        how to argue and discriminate, have moral sensibility and conscience, and the unconquerable will.</p>
      
    <p style="font-size: 22px;text-indent: 50px;">One of the practices in Spirituality is <B>worship</B>. Worship is regarded as an essential act to realize the ultimate meaning of transcendence and human life. Acts of worship may include
        prayer, reading the scripture(e.g.theBibleortheQuran), attending sacraments(e.g.mass),
        and doing sacrifices(e.g.fasting).</p>

    <p style="font-size: 22px;text-indent: 50px;">The spiritual aspect of the self is the inner essence, the part of the self that connects the person to the sacred, the supernatural, and the universe. The nurturing of the spiritual self also gives a deeper purpose or meaning to one's life.</p>
    
    <p style="font-size: 22px;text-indent: 50px;">People develop spirituality through interaction, observation, and imitation. Thus, the family, school, and church play a very important role in the spiritual development.</p>
    
    </br></br>
    
    <h1>SPIRITUALITY VS RELIGION</h1></br>  </br>
    <blockquote class="blockquote">
    <p style="font-size: 22px;text-indent: 50px;">Religion is a set of cultural beliefs and practices. It is an organized system of ideas about the spiritual sphere or the supernatural, and knowing God is its central function. Therefore, it is connected with spirituality.</p>

        <h1>Challenges and Issues that College Students Encounter about their Spiritual Self</h1>
      
      <img class="img-rounded me-3"src="spiritual_resources/pray.png" height="225px" style="float: left;">
      <p style="font-size: 22px; text-indent: 5%; margin-top: 40px;">Spiritual self plays an important role in every college student's life, although most of the time it is foreshadowed by our other aspect of self. There are questions that always appear in our mind as we experience challenges, issues, or problems on our daily life that concern our spiritual consciousness such as: what is the meaning of life? Why are we here? Is there a purpose? What will happen to us when we die? Is there a bigger, powerful, and higher One than us?</p>
      <p style="font-size: 22px; text-indent: 5%; margin-top: 40px;">Some college students tend to have a hard time believing in God or a higher being because of the suffering they either experience or see around them. These sentiments shared by college students focus to bring light to the wide range of difficult spiritual realizations and experiences that are often concealed and overlooked by educators. In fact, spiritual struggle is an experience with which many students are familiar, particularly those who concern themselves with deep reflection on faith, purpose, and life meaning. Many students find themselves perplexed by the notion of reconciling social injustice and suffering in the world with the promises of their religious traditions.</p>
      <p style="font-size: 22px;text-indent: 50px;">Recent estimates suggest that spiritual struggles are not uncommon aspects of college students' lives. According to the 2003 College Students' Beliefs and Values survey of college juniors, one-fifth of students reported that they frequently "struggled to understand evil, suffering, and death," while nearly the same number had frequently questioned their religious/spiritual beliefs. These studies suggest that psychological traits that leave one vulnerable to struggle include spiritual orientations that are not able to adequately address the problems of evil and suffering in the world, are insufficiently integrated into an individual's life, and are based on insecure religious attachments to an unpredictable or distant God (Pargament, Murray-Swank, Magyar, & Ano, 2005).</p>

      <h1 class="fs-1 fw-bolder">Importance of Ideal Self Concept Aligning with Actual Self</h1><br>
      <p style="font-size: 22px;text-indent: 50px;"> Congruence occurs when an individual's perception of their real self and ideal self is nearly identical. In other words, it refers to the alignment between one's concept of their ideal self and their actual self. When there is congruence, it promotes a sense of self-worth and contributes to a healthier and more productive life.</p>
      <p style="font-size: 22px;text-indent: 50px;">On the other hand, a person's ideal self may not be consistent with what happens in life and their experiences. As a result, a disparity may exist between a person's real self and their ideal self. This is known as incongruence. When there is a significant disparity between one's real self and their ideal self, they experience incongruence, which can lead to maladjustment.</p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 22px;text-indent: 50px;">Incongruent experiences with one's self are deemed unpleasant, resulting in feelings of inadequacy, anxiety, and distress. The greater the incongruence between the ideal self and the real self, the greater the resulting distress.</p>

      <p style="font-size: 22px;text-indent: 50px;"> Students that actively participate in inner work through self-reflection, contemplation, or meditation exhibit the most spiritual progress during college. We feel more connected to others around us and to a greater power when we are spiritually well. It may give you a feeling of purpose and belonging, make you feel calmer and more conscious, and give you hope when things aren't going as planned.</p>
